/*
 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
 * listed below.
 *
 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,
 * or any plugin's vendor/assets/stylesheets directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
 * compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any other CSS/SCSS
 * files in this directory. Styles in this file should be added after the last require_* statement.
 * It is generally better to create a new file per style scope.
 *
 * Below, require_tree turned OFF (notice = is missing), so we can manually
 * require each scss file in main.scss in a specific order. This idea
 * came from: http://www.mattboldt.com/organizing-css-and-sass-rails/
 * 
 * NOTE: Now, if you add a new css or scss file to the directory tree,
 *       you need to MANUALLY add it in an @import command in main.scss.
 *
 *  require_tree .       
 *= require_self         
 *= require select2.min  
 *= require main
